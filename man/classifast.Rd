\title{Compare different classification methods on multivariate data}
\usage{
classifast(x, y, prob = 0.65, method = c("simple"),
  kfold = ifelse(nrow(x) < 100, floor(nrow(x)/15), 10), cv.iter = 1,
  timing = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Data frame or matrix with multivariate data with n observations (rows) and p variables (cols)}

\item{y}{A factor with the labels of the rows of x}

\item{prob}{Percentage p for the split train-test data. (1-prob)\% is used for testing.}

\item{method}{Vector of the methods wanted. By default, "simple" gives you various lineal classifiers. Other possibilities are:

  - "log": Logistic or multinomial linear logistic regression via neural networks

  - "svm": Support Vector Machines with Radial Kernel

  - "knn": kNN with cross-validation choosing of K

  - "rforest": Random Forest

  - "simple": Trains "log", "svm", "knn" and "rforest".

  - "all": All implemented classifiers (time consuming)}

\item{kfold}{Number of folds in the cross validation estimation}

\item{cv.iter}{Number of iterations to do with cross validation.}

\item{timing}{if TRUE, shows you prediction of executing time. Feel free to ask the models we use.}
